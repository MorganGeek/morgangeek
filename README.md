# About me :alien:
- Who am I ? I’m Morgan and I’m Belgian :belgium:, from Brussels 🍻 🍫. I’m a programming geek and proud dad 👨‍🍼, with a lot of imagination, an appetite for knowledge 📚 🕸️ , information sharing and I enjoy too many passions to keep up with everything.
- What do I do ? I'm a software engineer by education and practice. I worked years as Software Developer then as DevOps/Cloud Infrastructure Engineer. I missed the fun of working with modern programming languages, so that's something I fixed in April 2022 by taking the opportunity to work as freelance Senior developer / Team lead, I've created my own company, named [Zoemp](https://github.com/Zoemp), with my partner. Anything involving AI, video games  🎮, productivity, positively impacting and helping people is interesting for me..
